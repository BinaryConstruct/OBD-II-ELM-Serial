#Description
Using a board based around the ELM327 I designed this simple software interface (c#) to communicate with my vehicles onboard OBD-II connection. The ultimate goal of this is to build a gauge display on an LCD driven by an ARM microprocessor. Currently the project is in its initial phase where I am working on decyphering the PIDs and their responses.
